These quantum materials hold the key not only to new advanced technologies but also to raise fundamental questions about the microscopic physical world. To understand such systems, it has become increasingly necessary to employ a combination of high-resolution spectroscopies and theoretical modeling of the interplay of spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom in parallel to disentangle the rich tapestry of complex properties. This two-week summer school aims to expose students to modern and emerging theoretical and experimental techniques, as well as their application to problems in the physical sciences and engineering. Lectures will be pedagogical, covering (i) the background quantum mechanical and many-body theory necessary to understand modern computational methods (e.g. second quantization, Green\u2019s functions, and functional integrals), (ii) introduce emerging material informatics and ML/Ai tools, and (iii) in-depth tutorial on key experimental techniques (e.g. ARPES, STM, RIXS, Neutron Scattering, Optical Spectroscopy), along with their theoretical underpinnings. Topics will be presented in a logical sequence to ensure all students are on the same footing. Extensive hands-on training using open-source codes will be an integral part of the school. Additionally, the students will visit three user facilities to show how the techniques learned in the classroom translate to real scientific problems. This school is open to both theoretical and experimental students who have completed at least one year of graduate work and is familiar with advanced quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. Each student will have the opportunity to present their work to encourage in-depth discussion. Questions are encouraged, free time, and hands-on sessions give ample time for students to interact with Faculty and with each other. This school will help train the next generation of researchers to use and develop these tools and methods in their own research programs.</p>"},{"location":"#important-dates","title":"Important Dates:","text":"Date Application open October 15, 2024 Application deadline January 1, 2025 Results announced January 15, 2025 Registration January 31, 2025 LANL onboarding package deadline March 1, 2025 Poster title and travel itinerary April 30, 2025 Arrival and check in June 8, 2025 Summer School June 9-20, 2025"},{"location":"#topics-covered","title":"Topics Covered","text":"<ul> <li>Foundations of Density Functional Theory and Electronic Structure</li> <li>The Effect of Electronic Correlations and Many-Body Theory</li> <li>Numerical Approach to the Many-Body Problem: DMRG, QMC, DMFT, Gutzwiller</li> <li>Background of Modern Experimental Spectroscopies, e.g. ARPES, STM, RIXS, Neutron Scattering, Optical Spectroscopy</li> <li>Material Informatics and ML/AI for Quantum Materials</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#how-to-apply-here","title":"How to Apply: here","text":""},{"location":"#organizers","title":"Organizers","text":"<ul> <li>Christopher Lane (T-4/LANL)</li> <li>Roxanne Tutchton (T-4/LANL)</li> <li>Elizabeth Peterson (T-4/LANL)</li> <li>Johanna Palmstrom (MPA-MAGLAB/LANL)</li> <li>Yue Huang (MPA-CINT/LANL)</li> <li>Ying Wai Li (CCS-7/LANL)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#sponsors","title":"Sponsors","text":"<ul> <li>Institute for Materials Science (IMS), LANL</li> <li>Center for Nonlinear Studies (CNLS), LANL</li> <li>Institutional Computing, LANL</li> </ul>"},{"location":"apply/","title":"Apply","text":"<p>To apply for the summer school, fill out this Google Form.</p> <p>(TODO: link to the Google Form)</p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>For questions and inquiries, contact [TBD].</p>"},{"location":"lecture_notes/","title":"Lecture notes","text":"<p>Lecture notes will be uploaded here at the end of each lecture.</p>"},{"location":"lecturers/","title":"Lecturers","text":"<p>TBD (combination of LANL and invited external leaders in their fields)</p>"},{"location":"location/","title":"Location","text":"<p>Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM (Building/room: TBD)</p>"},{"location":"location/#how-to-get-to-los-alamos","title":"How to get to Los Alamos?","text":"<p>Coming soon!</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/","title":"Tutorials","text":"<p>Tutorials, hands-on lab materials and codes will be available here for students to download.</p>"}]}
